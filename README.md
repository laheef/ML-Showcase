All work is my own.


#Contents:
## HW1: Trees
Own implementation of classification trees, bagging, and random forests on the housing dataset, with use of Gini Index for best split optimization. Reported misclassification rates for predefined hyperparameters.

## HW2: Logistic Regression
Own implementation of multinomial and ordinal logistic regression with MLE. Proposal of dataset on which the ordinal approach works notably better. Interpretation of model coefficients on a practical application, with quantification of uncertainty.

## HW3:  Kernelized Ridge Regression
**NOTE: The solution in this report contains faulty selection of columns (only first two) on the Housing Dataset.** The study of the application of kernels: notably ridge regression. Application of an own implementation to both a toy and practical dataset.

##HW4: Support Vector Regression
Own implementation of SVR, on toy and practical dataset., with two kernels. Comparison to results from HW3 and a comment on differences and similarities.

##HW5: Loss estimation
Own implementation of holdout estimation and cross validation, with several demonstration on selection methods' effect on model risk estimation and split/test data variability.

##HW6: Artificial Neural Network
Own implementation of a multi layer, fully connected ANN, with numerical verification of the gradient and application to a classification and regression dataset. Qualitative reasoning for performance differences on different hidden layer configurations is also provided.
